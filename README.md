This project is a timer base quiz on javascript where the user will enter their name then read the rules and condtions before startings the quiz and the timer.
When the user presses the button on the main page to begin the quiz, a random question from a source question bank will generate, taking the place of the main menue card 
The timer will also be generated at the top of the page and remain static. The user will need to select their answer before they are able to continue to the next. 
For each wrong answer the timer will drop by one minute.
Once the timer reaches zero or the user answers every question, their name and quiz points will be recorded. The user may also attempt the quiz again by the button at the end card.
